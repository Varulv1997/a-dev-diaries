A website is a predominant asset for a strong presence of your business digitally, creating a website these days is a simple task, but you want to start on an infrastructure you trust and own. </br>  </br>
This is where a <strong>Cloud Service</strong> stands out to the traditional hosting that limits your capabilities, pressures your business' budget and frustrates you out of countless migrations between "better hostings" with "different seducing options". </br>
On the other hand a Cloud Service is more about services than about just having some space on a shared server, having an E-Mail discount or having a free domain for the first month of your subscription. <strong>Cloud Services</strong> or <strong>Cloud Computing</strong> relies on sharing computing resources to store information, run applications, store data and process it, and provides multiple scalable services, reducing your cost per what you need, and controlling more the way your applications run, all on one single platform. </br> </br>

Today we're trying one of the well-reputed Cloud Services that I personally begun experimenting with since a year, <strong>IBM Cloud.</strong>
In this tutorial I will be explaining in detail how you can host your business' websites using <strong>IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS).</strong>

<h1 id="1f">Joining IBM Cloud</h1>
First, grab your free account on IBM Cloud <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/registration">Register Here</a>.</br>
</br><img src="/bl-content-assets/vl439TA.jpg"></img></br></br>
IBM Cloud gives you a <strong>$200 credit</strong> to access more than <strong>350 products</strong>, it also has a <strong>Lite</strong> plan that includes more than <strong>40 products</strong>, which we are going to use today.<br>
After creating your account you will be greeted with a nice and clean dashboard where you can monitor all your products/services and their usages, the dashboard also contains useful tutorials for some of the products.
<br><br><img src="/bl-content-assets/09ADLK4.jpg"></img>
<br>
<br>
From the same beautiful dashboard we are going to <strong>create our first resource</strong>, which is basically the service you're going to be using, a resource can be managed by you directly and also by fellow team mates that are welcome to join you on IBM Cloud via the IAM Console. Resources can be either IBM services or third party ones, we are going to use IBM's in this tutorial, and in this case, <strong>IBM Cloud Object Storage or COS.</strong>
<br>
<br>
<strong>IBM Cloud Object Storage</strong> is a service for storing and accessing data. The object storage service can be deployed on-premise, as part of IBM Cloud Platform, or in hybrid form. It supports exponential data growth and cloud-native workloads with built-in high-speed file transfer capabilities, cross-region offerings and can be easily integrated with other IBM Cloud services.
<br>
<br>
<h1 id="2f">Creating a COS resource</h1>
Let's begin by creating our first resource using the <strong>Create resource</strong> button in the main dashboard.
<br></br>
<img src="/bl-content-assets/VduxnKC.png"></img>
<br><br>
We will be redirected to the IBM Catalog which contains all services on the platform, quite a nice minimal catalog in comparison with other Cloud Services in my opinion.<br><br>
<img src="/bl-content-assets/vfCJ4Nc.png"></img>
<br><br>
Select <strong>Services</strong> from the sidebar and search for <strong>IBM Cloud Object Storage</strong>, you can access it directly from this link: <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/objectstorage/create">IBM Cloud Object Storage</a>
<br><br>
<img src="/bl-content-assets/NOtpIbw.png"></img>
<br><br>
From this page you can create a <strong>Cloud Object Storage Instance</strong> which will host our small business websites.
<br><br>
<img src="/bl-content-assets/pDRs3yW.png"></img>
<br><br>
You can set a name to your instance down the page in the <strong>Service Name field</strong>, I will go with <strong>"my-business"</strong>, you can leave the resource group dropdown to the <strong>"Default"</strong> option and you can set any <strong>Tags</strong> to it (but avoid sensitive data as those Tags are visible account-wide).
<br><br>
<img src="/bl-content-assets/2Cxu8fx.png"></img>
<br><br>
After setting all your details it's time to fire up our Cloud Object Storage Instance, simply click the big blue <strong>Create</strong> button.
We will be redirected to our COS instance's page.
<br><br>
<h1 id="21f">Creating a bucket</h1>
Next up we need to create a bucket.
<br>A bucket is a storage container/space within the COS instance, Cloud Object Storage instances can contain multiple buckets with different content while maintaining high availability and transfer speeds. We will create a new bucket by clicking the <strong>"Create bucket"</strong> button.
<br><br>
<img src="/bl-content-assets/z369lbb.png"></img>
<br><br>
But hold up, we still didn't finish yet with our little bucket, after clicking the creation button we'll be redirected to a new page where we can setup our bucket's options, buckets can be fancy these days.
<br>You can chose the predefined bucket templates if you're in a hurry, but I'm a details lover so I will go with <strong>"Customize your bucket".</strong>
<br><br>
<img src="/bl-content-assets/EamoDgZ.png"></img>
<br><br>
We will be selecting a regional resiliency after setting a name to our bucket (it must be unique in your COS instance), seems fine to me. <br>I'm choosing the <strong>us-south</strong> location, it's always my choice in all Cloud Services for some unknown magical reason although I don't live in the U.S.
<br>I'm also choosing the new <strong>Smart Tier</strong> for a better automated control of my usages. <br> After setting up the options that I find fit for our new bucket, we'll simply launch it using the <strong>"Create bucket"</strong> button, it's as easy as drinking water, but don't drink it from the bucket though, it's still empty.
<br><br>
<img src="/bl-content-assets/yVkPgCs.jpg"></img>
<br><br>
<h1 id="22f">Setting the bucket's access to Public</h1>
Before we proceed to uploading our websites to the bucket we have to make sure the bucket is accessible to the public, this step is optional and can be skipped, however if you want your website to be visible to everyone, this step is necessary, but only needs 30 seconds of your time.
<br>From the bucket dashboard browse to <strong>"Access Policies"</strong> from the left sidebar, then to the <strong>"Access Groups"</strong> tab.
	<br>Set Access group to: <strong>Public Access</strong>.
	<br>Then set Role for this bucket to: <strong>Content Reader</strong>.<br><br>
	<img src="/bl-content-assets/MILCFjl.png"></img>
	<br><br>
	Enable the new policy.
	<br><br>
	<img src="/bl-content-assets/H9S2OO6.png"></img>	
	<br><br>
	Our little bucket is now publicly accessible and its content can be viewed by everyone with a direct link to the content.
	<br>
<h1 id="3f">Uploading the websites' assets</h1>
Now that we created our bucket it's time to fill it up, I will be using 5 different open source websites of mine, anyone can get them on my GitHub page.<br>We'll start by going to the <strong>"Objects"</strong> page on the left sidebar. <br>
I will be selecting the<strong>"Upload"</strong> button then folders, in this case I'm uploading multiple assets of different websites so the folders option would be more suitable.
<br><br>
<img src="/bl-content-assets/Qr2JofR.png"></img>
<br><br>
IBM Cloud has a nice desktop client supported by a browser extension that can upload files faster, called <strong>Aspera</strong>. I will skip the downloading and installation process but it usually doesn't take more than 2 minutes.
<br><br>
<img src="/bl-content-assets/AiTUkkl.png"></img>
<br><br>
After installing the Aspera client and the browser extension, I can now upload the folders of our projects easily and super fast.
<br><br>
<img src="/bl-content-assets/1vV7X20.png"></img>
<br><br>
The desktop client takes care of uploading my folders with high speed in-sync with IBM Cloud's Object Storage service, I'm uploading 5 different websites of mine beginning with After Hours Plumbing Inc, which is a plumbing business website, I will be listing all websites later in this tutorial.
<br><br>
<img src="/bl-content-assets/UJTQ1Nl.png"></img>
<br><br>
<h1 id="4f">Accessing the websites</h1>
Our folders are now uploaded thanks to Aspera, we can proceed to access each website using their public URLs.<br>
(Note that if you skipped <a href="#22f">Step 2.2</a> you will not be able to access any file since they aren't using a public policy.)
<br>
We can access our websites using their respective URLs that are available in the <strong>"Objects"</strong> page.
<br> By clicking the three dots at the right side of each file/folder a dropdown with multiple options will show up, we're going for <strong>"Object details"</strong>
<br><br>
<img src="/bl-content-assets/nowH4LK.png"></img>
<br><br>
The <strong>Object details</strong> panel will display details about the object and options to delete or download it, it will also display a <strong>"Object Public URL"</strong> link, that's our direct link to the website that we uploaded as a folder earlier using Aspera.
<br><br>
<img src="/bl-content-assets/TmWFuBz.png"></img>
<br><br>
Accessing the direct Object Public URL sends us to our uploaded websites now.<br>
