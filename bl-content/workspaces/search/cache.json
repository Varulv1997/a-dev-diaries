A flat system provides more performance and excellent security.\nOn the other hand Cloud Foundry is an open source cloud platform as a service (PaaS) that provides a choice of clouds, application services, and developer frameworks. It makes the process of building, testing, deploying and scaling applications smoother and faster.\nAnd today we will be using IBM's Cloud Foundry to deploy a small database-less blog.\n\n    #toc_container {\n    background: #f9f9f9 none repeat scroll 0 0;\n    border: 1px solid #aaa;\n    display: table;\n    font-size: 95%;\n    margin-top: 15px;\n      margin-bottom: 15px;\n    padding: 20px;\n    width: auto;\n      padding: 15px;\n    padding-left: 0px;\n    padding-bottom: 0px;\n}\n\n.toc_title {\n    font-weight: 700;\n    text-align: center;\n    font-size: 16px;\n    font-family: Raleway;\n    color: #1f1a30 !important;\n}\n\n#toc_container li, #toc_container ul, #toc_container ul li{\n    list-style: outside none none !important;\n}\n    \n&lt;div id=\"toc_container\"&gt;\nContents\n\n  1 - Joining IBM Cloud\n\n    \n            2 - Creating a Cloud Foundry resource\n          3 - Deploy app\n    \n\n\n\nJoining IBM Cloud\nFirst, create your free account on IBM Cloud You can register here.\n\nIBM Cloud gives you a $200 credit to access a large set of +350 products, it also has a Lite plan that includes more than 40 products, which we intend to use today.\nAfter creating your account you will be greeted with a minimal and clean dashboard where you can monitor all your products\/services and their usages, the dashboard also contains useful tutorials for some of the products.\n\n\n\nFrom this dashboard we are going to create our first resource, which is basically the service you're going to be using, a resource can be managed by you directly and also by team members that are welcome to join you on IBM Cloud via the IAM Console. Resources can be either IBM services or third party ones, we are going to use IBM's in this tutorial, and in this case, IBM Cloud Foundry.\n\n\nCreating a Cloud Foundry resource\nWe will start by creating a Cloud Foundry resource or instance to deploy our app, the Cloud Foundry panel is available and accessible from the left sidebar on our IBM Cloud dashboard.\n\n\n\nAfter navigating to the Cloud Foundry dashboard, we are going to create a new Cloud Foundry instance using the &quot;Create&quot; button.\n\n\n\nWe are then redirected to a configuration page to setup our new app.\nFor the region I will be choosing Dallas, big things happen there, and for sure will do here also.\nThe pricing plan we're selecting is the Lite plan, since this tutorial involves free IBM Cloud products, with 128MB of memory. The blog we're deploying today runs on PHP, so I will be selecting the PHP Community runtime.\nAfter setting our region, plan, runtime and app name\/domain we can now hit that &quot;Create&quot; button to launch our app sky-high.\n\n\n\nDeploy app\nBefore we deploy our app, we need to have the IBM CLI installed on our machine, the CLI connects you to various IBM services and makes the operations easier between your local machines and the IBM remote ones.\nWe can get the latest version here IBM CLI Docs\n\nIn this tutorial I'm using a Windows machine, so I will be downloading the IBM CLI for Windows setup, a simple fast installer.\nAfter installing the IBM CLI We can simply start any terminal-like software, or the default Windows Command Prompt (CMD) and browse to our project's directory.\n\nI will be using an open source project that I personally contributed to over the years to deploy our app which can be found here Bludit.\n\n\nBefore we log-in into IBM Cloud Foundry using the IBM CLI, we need a custom configuration to override the default IBM"},"a":{"title":"About","description":"","content":"Hello there !

Cloud Services or Cloud Computing relies on sharing computing resources to store information, run applications, store data and process it, and provides multiple scalable services, reducing your cost per what you need, and controlling more the way your applications run, all on one single platform.  \nToday we're trying one of the well-reputated Cloud Services that I personally begun experimenting with since a year, IBM Cloud.\nIn this tutorial I will be explaining in detail how you can host your business' websites using IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS).\n\n    #toc_container {\n    background: #f9f9f9 none repeat scroll 0 0;\n    border: 1px solid #aaa;\n    display: table;\n    font-size: 95%;\n    margin-top: 15px;\n      margin-bottom: 15px;\n    padding: 20px;\n    width: auto;\n      padding: 15px;\n    padding-left: 0px;\n    padding-bottom: 0px;\n}\n\n.toc_title {\n    font-weight: 700;\n    text-align: center;\n    font-size: 16px;\n    font-family: Raleway;\n    color: #1f1a30 !important;\n}\n\n#toc_container li, #toc_container ul, #toc_container ul li{\n    list-style: outside none none !important;\n}\n    \n&lt;div id=\"toc_container\"&gt;\nContents\n\n  1 - Joining IBM Cloud\n\n    \n            2 - Creating a COS resource\n          \n    2.1 Creating a bucket\n    2.2 Setting the bucket's access to Public\n  \n      3 - Uploading the websites' assets\n      4 - Accessing the websites\n    \n\n\n\nJoining IBM Cloud\nFirst, grab your free account on IBM Cloud Register Here.\n\nIBM Cloud gives you a $200 credit to access more than 350 products, it also has a Lite plan that includes more than 40 products, which we are going to use today.\nAfter creating your account you will be greeted with a nice and clean dashboard where you can monitor all your products\/services and their usages, the dashboard also contains useful tutorials for some of the products.\n\n\n\nFrom the same beautiful dashboard we are going to create our first resource, which is basically the service you're going to be using, a resource can be managed by you directly and also by fellow team mates that are welcome to join you on IBM Cloud via the IAM Console. Resources can be either IBM services or third party ones, we are going to use IBM's in this tutorial, and in this case, IBM Cloud Object Storage or COS.\n\n\nIBM Cloud Object Storage is a service for storing and accessing data. The object storage service can be deployed on-premise, as part of IBM Cloud Platform, or in hybrid form. It supports exponential data growth and cloud-native workloads with built-in high-speed file transfer capabilities, cross-region offerings and can be easily integrated with other IBM Cloud services.\n\n\nCreating a COS resource\nLet's begin by creating our first resource using the Create resource button in the main dashboard.\n\n\n\nWe will be redirected to the IBM Catalog which contains all services on the platform, quite a nice minimal catalog in comparison with other Cloud Services in my opinion.\n\n\nSelect Services from the sidebar and search for IBM Cloud Object Storage, you can access it directly from this link: IBM Cloud Object Storage\n\n\n\nFrom this page you can create a Cloud Object Storage Instance which will host our small business websites.\n\n\n\nYou can set a name to your instance down the page in the Service Name field, I will go with &quot;my-business&quot;, you can leave the resource gr"}}
